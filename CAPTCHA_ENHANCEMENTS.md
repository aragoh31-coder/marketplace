# 🎨 Enhanced CAPTCHA System

## Major Improvements Made

### 1. **Dynamic Shape Variety** 🔄
Instead of just Pac-Man circles, the captcha now randomly shows different target shapes:

- **🟡 Pac-Man**: Circle with a missing slice
- **🍕 Pizza**: Circle with one slice removed
- **⭐ Star**: 5-pointed star shape
- **🍩 Donut**: Circle with a hole in the center
- **🌙 Crescent**: Moon-shaped curve
- **♦️ Diamond**: 4-pointed diamond shape

### 2. **Enhanced Background Noise** 🌫️
Added multiple layers of visual noise to prevent bot detection:

- Random background shapes (ellipses and rectangles)
- Scattered dots with varying opacity
- Wavy lines across the image
- Textured background patterns
- All noise is subtle to maintain human readability

### 3. **Improved User Experience** ✨
- **Larger tolerance**: 50% of radius + 5 pixels margin
- **Bigger shapes**: 25-35 pixel radius (was 20-28)
- **Clearer instructions**: "Click the shape that looks different"
- **Shape hints**: Users are told what shapes to look for

## How It Works Now

1. **Shape Generation**: System randomly picks one of 6 different shape types
2. **Target Placement**: The unique shape is placed among regular circles
3. **Background Noise**: Multiple layers of noise make bot detection harder
4. **Validation**: Click anywhere reasonably close to the unique shape

## Visual Examples

```
Before (Only Pac-Man):
  ⭕ ⭕ 🟡 ⭕ ⭕

Now (Various Shapes):
  ⭕ ⭕ ⭐ ⭕ ⭕  (Star among circles)
  ⭕ 🍕 ⭕ ⭕ ⭕  (Pizza among circles)
  ⭕ ⭕ ⭕ 🍩 ⭕  (Donut among circles)
  ⭕ 🌙 ⭕ ⭕ ⭕  (Crescent among circles)
  ♦️ ⭕ ⭕ ⭕ ⭕  (Diamond among circles)
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Harder for Bots**: Shape variety prevents pattern recognition
2. **Background Noise**: Makes image analysis more difficult
3. **Random Positioning**: Target can be anywhere
4. **Session-Based**: Each captcha is unique to the session

## User Benefits

1. **More Interesting**: Different shapes keep it engaging
2. **Very Forgiving**: Large click tolerance
3. **Clear Instructions**: Users know what to look for
4. **No JavaScript**: Still works with maximum Tor security
