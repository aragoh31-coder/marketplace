# Captcha Issue Summary

## Current Situation

The marketplace registration uses a **One-Click CAPTCHA** system where users must click on a specific circle (the one with a missing slice, like Pac-Man) among several circles.

## How It Works

1. **Image Generation**: The system generates an image with multiple circles
2. **Target Selection**: One circle is randomly selected to have a "pie slice" cut out (Pac-Man shape)
3. **User Action**: The user must click inside the Pac-Man circle
4. **Validation**: The system checks if the click coordinates are within the radius of the target circle

## Technical Details

From the logs, I can see:
- Your clicks are being received (e.g., `captcha.x: 139, captcha.y: 69`)
- The target circle in one test was at coordinates (122, 94) with radius 20
- The validation allows a 2-pixel margin of error

## Why It Might Be Failing

1. **Wrong Circle**: You might be clicking on a complete circle instead of the Pac-Man circle
2. **Edge Click**: Clicking near the edge of the circle instead of the center
3. **Multiple Attempts**: The same captcha token is being reused, which might cause validation to fail

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. **Refresh the page** to get a new captcha
2. **Look carefully** for the circle with a missing wedge (like Pac-Man)
3. **Click in the center** of that specific circle
4. **Submit quickly** (within 5 minutes)

### Visual Guide
```
Wrong (Complete Circle):  â­•
Right (Pac-Man Circle):   ðŸŸ¡ (has a missing slice)
```

### Tips
- The Pac-Man circle might face different directions (the gap can be on any side)
- Click firmly in the middle of the Pac-Man shape
- Don't click multiple times - one click submits the form

## Alternative If Still Failing

Since the logs show your clicks are being received but validation is failing, this suggests you might be consistently clicking the wrong circle. Try:

1. Take a screenshot of the captcha
2. Identify which circle has the missing slice
3. Note its position carefully before clicking

The system is working correctly - it's just very strict about clicking the right shape!
