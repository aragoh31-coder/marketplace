# TOTP Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. QR Code Too Large for Mobile
**Problem**: The TOTP QR code was too big and didn't fit on mobile screens.

**Solution**:
- Reduced QR code generation parameters in `/workspace/accounts/totp_service.py`:
  - `box_size`: 10 → 5
  - `border`: 4 → 2
- Added responsive CSS in `/workspace/templates/accounts/totp_setup.html`:
  - Desktop: max-width 200px
  - Mobile (<576px): max-width 150px
  - Made manual entry code mobile-friendly

### 2. Access Denied After TOTP Setup
**Problem**: After enabling TOTP, users got a white "access denied" page when redirected to backup codes.

**Solution**:
- Updated `/workspace/apps/security/middleware.py` to whitelist `/accounts/` URLs
- This allows account-related pages to bypass the security challenge requirement

### 3. Missing Template Error
**Problem**: Trying to disable TOTP resulted in "TemplateDoesNotExist: accounts/totp_disable.html"

**Solution**:
- Created `/workspace/templates/accounts/totp_disable.html` with:
  - Password confirmation form
  - Warning about security implications
  - Responsive design for mobile
