# ✅ Captcha Tolerance Improved!

## Changes Made

The One-Click CAPTCHA system has been made **MUCH more forgiving** for both login and registration.

### 1. **Increased Click Tolerance**
- **Before**: Only 2-pixel margin of error
- **After**: 50% of circle radius + 5 pixels margin
- **Example**: For a circle with 30-pixel radius, you now have a 20-pixel margin instead of just 2 pixels!

### 2. **Larger Click Targets**
- **Before**: Circles were 20-28 pixels radius
- **After**: Circles are now 25-35 pixels radius
- **Result**: Bigger, easier-to-click targets

### 3. **What This Means**
- You can now click **anywhere near** the Pac-Man circle, not just dead center
- Even if you're slightly outside the visible circle, it will likely still accept your click
- The system is now much more user-friendly while still preventing bots

## Visual Representation

```
Before (Very Strict):
    Target: [●]  <- Must click exactly here
    
After (Forgiving):
    Target: [(   ●   )]  <- Can click anywhere in this area
```

## Technical Details

For a typical circle:
- **Visible radius**: 30 pixels
- **Old clickable area**: 32-pixel radius (barely larger)
- **New clickable area**: 50-pixel radius (much more forgiving!)

The validation now uses:
```
margin = (radius × 0.5) + 5 pixels
```

This makes the captcha still secure against bots but MUCH easier for real users!

**Try it now! The captcha should be much more forgiving when clicking on or near the Pac-Man circle.**
